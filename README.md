# WaveChatðŸ‘‹

WaveChat is a communication platform designed to empower the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community by making sign language communication more accessible. The application uses gesture recognition to interpret sign language in real time, enabling seamless interaction through video chats. With support for mobile, desktop, and cloud-based platforms, WaveChat ensures communication is inclusive, efficient, and intuitive. Users can chat, type, or gesture in their preferred language, which is then seamlessly translated into the end-user's language, ensuring smooth and accessible communication for everyone.
